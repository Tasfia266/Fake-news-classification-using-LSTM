# Fake-news-classification-using-LSTM
Classification of news as fake or real using Long short term memory (LSTM). LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that succeeded to overcome the limitations of RNN such as gradient vanishing and exploding. ![MC-LSTM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76652458/190477302-c4d45eca-a3da-45ae-8ffc-d117de80cd34.jpg)


Here the texts need to be preprocessed before applying LSTM. The steps invloved in text preprocessing are: 
1. Stemming- which is a technique used to extract the base form of the word by removing affixes. 
2. One hot representation- vector representation of words in a vocabulary 
3. Word Embedding- learned representation for text in which words that have simiar meaning get similar representation. 
The model was trained using Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used here can be found on kaggle.
